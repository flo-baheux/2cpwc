Whiskers of the Heart is a story-driven local coop 2D platformer, made by a team in 6 days during the gamejam organized by TheXPlace x Unity (Summer Game Jam 2024).  Theme was TRAVEL! It explores the story of Simba and Bastet, 2 cats that met by fate and started a journey to the Ancient City of Cats. While traveling, they encounter a dark secret regarding one of their local deities, The Goddess of Death.

Bastet is a kitten, fast as the wind but who cannot jump very high. Simba being older can jump high, but is comparatively slower. By having asymmetrical gameplay the two players have to take the best path and jump over threats to help each others to move forward on their journey!
